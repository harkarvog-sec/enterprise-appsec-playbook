# Access Control Testing

Access control is a critical security boundary that protects sensitive resources from unauthorized access. Weak or misconfigured access controls are a leading cause of horizontal and vertical privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure, and business logic abuse.

This module documents a manual, attacker-driven approach to testing access controls across web, API, and distributed systems.

## Scope

Horizontal access control (users accessing other users’ data)  
Vertical access control (users accessing admin functions)  
Role-based and attribute-based access control enforcement  
Object-level, field-level, and API endpoint-level access restrictions  
Multi-tenant access isolation

---

## Outcome

Successful testing demonstrates:

Whether access control boundaries are consistently enforced  
Whether privilege escalation is possible  
Whether sensitive resources are protected against unauthorized access
