# Reporting & Security Automation

In enterprise application security, discovering vulnerabilities is only half the job. The real value of security testing is realized when findings are clearly communicated, prioritized, and acted upon by engineering, leadership, and compliance stakeholders.

This module documents how security findings are transformed from raw testing output into structured, reproducible, and automation-friendly reports that scale across large organizations.
